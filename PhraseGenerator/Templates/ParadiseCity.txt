@1Paradise @2City

<Take> <me> down
<To> <the> @1paradise @2city
<Where> <the> grass <is> green
<And> <the> girls <are> [jj] 
Take <me> home

<Just> an urchin
living <under> <the> street
<I'm> <a> hard case
<that> <is> tough <to> beat
<I'm> <your> charity case
<So> buy <me> something <to> eat
<I'll> pay <you> <at> another time
Take <it> <to> <the> end of the line

Rags <to> riches <or> <so> they say
You <got> <to> keep pushing
<for> <the> fortune and fame
<It's> all <a> gamble
When <it's> <just> a game
<You> treat <it> <like> a capital crime
<Everybody> <is> doing their time

Strapped <in> <the> chair
<of> <the> city's gas chamber
Why I'm here <I> <can't> quite remember
<The> surgeon general says
<it's> hazardous <to> breathe
<I'd> have <another> cigarette
<but> <I> <can't> see
Tell <me> who <you're> <going> <to> believe

Captain America <has> been torn apart
Now he <is> <a> court jester
with a broken heart
He said-
Turn me around and
take me back to the start
I <must> <be> losing <my> mind-
"Are you blind?"
<I've> seen <it> all a million times
